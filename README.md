## üí° About the project

> _Building my own basic C static library, which will be used throughout the rest of the program (42 Cursus). The ```ft_*``` functions mostly mimic the behaviour of the traditional C functions, and must be written using at most ```write()``` and ```malloc()```.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Requirements

The function is written in C language and thus needs the **`gcc` compiler** and some standard **C libraries** to run.

### Instructions

**1. Compiling the library**

To compile, download the archives, go to the library path and run the command in your terminal :

```shell
$ make
```

**2. Using it in your code**

To use the library functions in your code, simply include its header:

```C
#include "libft.h"
```
